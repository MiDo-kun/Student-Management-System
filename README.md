## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained the following knowledge and skills:

- How to connect PHP to a MySQL database.
- How to use HTTP methods such as POST in PHP to listen for incoming requests, perform specific actions and display the data by using template literals.
- How to use `mysqli_real_escape_string()` to escape strings for security against threats or attacks.
- How to use Sweet Alert to create modals.
- How to use AJAX-based HTTP requests using jQuery.
- How to use primary keys when designing database tables and why it is important to keep records unique.

Overall, this project provided me with a solid foundation in modern web development using PHP, AJAX and related technologies. The skills and knowledge I gained will be useful in future web development projects.
